# Rails Bookmarker

In this assignment we'll revisit the [Sinatra Bookmarker](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/wdi_3_ruby_lab_sinatra_bookmarks), building the same functionality in Rails.

## Assignment

Create a Rails app that allows me to track my bookmarks. A "bookmark" consists of a URL and a title. I should be able to see all my bookmarks in one place (and click on them to go to the URL), add new bookmarks, and edit or delete existing bookmarks.

## Bonus Stage

Upgrade your bookmarker to a URL shortener! In the list view, each bookmark should display a second URL *internal to your app* that, when I click on it or type it into my browser, redirects me to the real URL. Don't worry about actually making the URLs short &ndash; the idea here is to redirect me out of your app when I visit a URL within it.
